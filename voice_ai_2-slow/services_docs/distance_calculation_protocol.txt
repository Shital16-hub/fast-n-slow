SERVICE: Distance Calculation and Mileage-Based Pricing Protocol
DESCRIPTION: Standardized process for calculating distances and applying mileage-based charges for towing and delivery services.
REQUIREMENTS: Starting location, destination location, GPS or mapping service access
TIME: 2-5 minutes for calculation process

DISTANCE_CALCULATION_PROTOCOL:
Step 1: Customer Response
- Output: "Please wait while I calculate the distance between your starting and final locations."
- Inform customer that accurate distance calculation ensures fair pricing

Step 2: Primary Calculation Method  
- Use Google Maps API or similar mapping service
- Calculate driving distance between start location and destination
- Store calculated distance in system variable
- Verify route accessibility for service vehicles

Step 3: Fallback Method (if API fails)
- Prompt: "Could you please provide the approximate total mileage between the starting and final locations?"
- Accept customer-provided mileage estimate
- Store provided distance for pricing calculation
- Confirm distance with customer before finalizing price

Step 4: Distance-Based Pricing Application
- Apply appropriate per-mile rate based on service type:
  * Towing short distance: $8 per mile
  * Towing long distance: $10 per mile  
  * Towing standard rate: $9 per mile
  * Fuel delivery: $5 per mile over 5 miles
- Calculate total distance charges
- Add to base service fees

Step 5: Price Confirmation
- Present total calculated price to customer
- Break down charges: base fee + distance charges  
- Confirm customer acceptance before dispatch
- Document final agreed pricing

DISTANCE_MEASUREMENT_STANDARDS:
- Use most direct driveable route
- Account for service vehicle accessibility
- Round up to nearest half mile for billing
- Highway miles vs city miles: standard rate applies to both
- Traffic conditions: do not affect distance calculation

PRICING_TRANSPARENCY:
- Always explain distance calculation method used
- Provide breakdown of base fee + mileage charges
- Confirm total price before service commitment
- Offer route alternatives if available for cost savings

QUALITY_ASSURANCE:
- GPS verification of actual route when possible
- Customer signature on distance acknowledgment
- Service documentation includes actual vs estimated distance
- Post-service verification available upon customer request
